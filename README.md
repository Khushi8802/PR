It is recommended that every individual should have adequate time of quality sleep in a day. If we fail to get sufficient sleep, it accumulates like a debt- a sleep debt. Insufficient sleep can pose a serious threat while driving. It can make us feel fatigued and impair our ability to react and think clearly, leading to a higher risk of accidents. If one is driving at a certain speed and if suddenly the driver falls asleep for just few seconds, the car will travel a sufficient distance without any control. Certain groups of drivers are more vulnerable to accidents due to drowsiness:
1) Individuals who operate heavy vehicles, such as large trucks.
2) Drivers who have sleep disorders that affect their sleep quality.
3) Inexperienced young drivers who may not recognize the significance of being well-rested.
Therefore, it is crucial for all drivers, particularly those at risk, to get enough sleep to ensure their safety on the road.
For this purpose, it is required to detect whether the eyes are closed or open or half-closed. This detection can be done with some measurements with facial components like eyes position, eye lid movement, etc. Euclidean distance may help to get such calculations. This measurement also can be done through determining the facial landmarks.

B.	Euclidean Distance
In coordinate geometry, Euclidean distance is the distance between two points. To find the two points on a plane, the length of a segment connecting the two points is measured. We derive the Euclidean distance formula using the Pythagoras theorem.
